# Clothes Price Prediction

This project focuses on **predicting clothes prices** using data analytics and machine learning techniques. It involves exploring the dataset, cleaning and preparing the data, applying predictive models, and analyzing performance.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `clothes_price_prediction_data.csv` → Dataset containing clothing items and their attributes.
- `Clothes_price_prediction.ipynb.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and model building.
- `README.md` → Project documentation (this file).

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes clothing-related features and their corresponding prices. These features are used to train models to predict prices more accurately.

> ✨ You can extend the dataset section with details about number of rows, columns, and key attributes after exploring the CSV file.

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

## 🚀 Usage
Open the notebook and run step by step:

```bash
jupyter notebook Clothes_price_prediction.ipynb.ipynb
```

Follow the workflow in the notebook:
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
3. Model training (regression / ML models)
4. Evaluation of results

## 📈 Results
- Key findings and visualizations
- Model accuracy and performance metrics

(*Add screenshots of graphs and results from your notebook here*)

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more advanced ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Improve dataset quality and size
- Build a deployment-ready API or web app
